Some people think when they stop going to school it means they stop learning. Some think they are done with learning just because they are not in school. Some do not care to broaden their knowledge and others are just lazy. Honestly, I am a really lazy person even though I am passionate about learning. As a graduating student at Carmel High School, I am afraid that I will lose my passion for learning because I will be leaving high school in June. When I want to give up on learning, I hope this memoir will remind me why I love to learn and will encourage me to learn for a long time.
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
    I am writing this memoir during the spring 2020 shelter-in-place. During this pandemic, it is hard for people to learn. It is hard for me too. I have to motivate myself to wake up, get out of bed, and sit down to do my homework. I am really lazy, but I really want to get good grades in class. My senior year will never be back again, and I only have one chance to make it memorable before it's too late. I am writing about learning because learning has changed my life and I want to inspire myself and my readers to never stop learning. This project recalls my memories and my perspective on learning. I will hopefully become a lifelong learner. Because I am a senior, I have very little time left in high school. I want to do something to make a mark in my life on the journey to becoming a lifelong learner. I also want to motivate myself to learn more and to try to find out how to become a lifelong learner. 
              <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        I am really excited about this memoir because I know when I get out of high school it will be hard to find the time to explore my interest in learning. At eighteen years old, I also want to explore myself and reflect on what I have done over the last eighteen years. I have asked myself, “Is the person I am today really who I want to be?” Eighteen is a mark for everyone; it’s also a mark for my life. I want to see deep down what I am doing now with my life on the way to achieving my goals. I am truly thankful for this opportunity to have time to work on my passion about learning and do self-reflection about my life.

        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
Let’s go back to my first day of elementary school. My uniform, a white t-shirt and blue pants, was handed down to me by my neighbor. On the front of the shirt was my name tag embroidered with scrawled red thread. I was excited when I wore the uniform because it meant I was a first grade student. My mom rode me to school on her bike and she left for work. I was wandering in the school yard looking for the way to get to class in a crowd of people. When I got into class, I chose the seat near the door. That class had another person with the same name as me, so when the teacher called roll, I raised my hand up with the other kid. I did not know if she was referring to me or not because I did not know my full name. Some of my friends' parents were talking behind my back about why I was in the first grade without knowing my name. It made me feel that school was not as fun as I thought. I was not interested in learning. I did not want to go to school for the second day. I thought I would never fall in love with learning when people commented on me but my journey still keeps going. 
             <p style="text-indent: 40px"> 
                 After the first day of school, I had to walk one mile to school by myself everyday. I felt jealous of my friends who had parents who gave them a ride to school. Some day, my oldest brother picked me up after school some days on the old bike we bought from our neighbour if he didn't have school that day. Beside the road was a rice field for a half mile and then a lotus field for a half mile. There were houses around that looked old and run-down on the way home. The sound of rustling bamboo leaves and the sound of birds chirping in harmony gave me a feeling of peace and tranquility. Every day, I was awakened by the rooster’s crow and walked alone on that road to school. I was inexperienced in school because I did not go to preschool. I did not have manners, so I did not know how to act in school. <p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        I learned the most about behavior from my two older brothers who always encouraged me to learn. My parents divorced at that time. I was living with my mom and my brothers. By coincidence when I cleaned my oldest brother’s room, I found a piece of paper in his backpack with a note in a margin that said he wanted to give me a chance to get a better education. He was trying to motivate himself for my benefit. The reason why my oldest brother dropped out of college was to work and provide me with a better life. It reminds me I have to work harder.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      My parents divorced when I was in second grade. Because of the divorce, I didn’t have anyone who was able to take the time to help me with my school work. Every day, after school, I saw my friend or other kids who have parents come to pick them up. I was jealous of them because they had what I do not have. One day, my dad came to visit me and gave me some money, and when my best friend,Vinh, saw me with the money, she thought that I stole from her because normally I did not have money for snacks. Since that time my relationship with my friends was not good because some of them thought poorly of me because Vinh told them all I was a thief. So after school, they walked home together and I walked home by myself a different way. Having no friends gave me a lot of free time.
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  I was looking for something to fill up time. I tried looking for something to read. I had one really old comic book missing some pages at the beginning. I read that book more than 100 times until I remembered everything in detail. I still do. That is the first time I fell in love with reading. Having books to read was a dream, but I did not have that opportunity. In Vietnam, the public library charges money to borrow books to read, but I didn’t have any money, so I could not borrow any. 
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
 At the time my parents divorced, my life became really chaotic, but in fifth grade, I experienced one of the biggest changes in my life. I had a home room teacher called Mrs. Phuong who really cared about me. In the traditional style, she had long black hair and walked like a muse around class with a book in her hand teaching us lessons. She always told us we needed to be careful because every mistake counts. For example, in math if you write the wrong number it will create a huge difference. She motivated me to want to be successful through motivational speeches in the front of class everyday. Since that year, my life has changed a lot. Sometimes what she said about my school work hurt my feelings, but it was all true. She movatited me to be less lazy. I wanted to achieve my goals, because if not, I would have a terrible future. I became focused on and interested in learning more.
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
By the time I was in middle school, I saw myself working harder not only for a good grade. Many hours I sat at my desk doing school work, trying to learn new things as much as I could. With fewer hours of sleep, I could go to bed at 2:00 am and wake up at 6:00 am ready for school. It was crazy when I think about it now.
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
 At this time I started surrounding myself with people who had more talent than me. I had learnt so much from them. It motivated me. I pushed myself to get a higher grade and tried to gain my knowledge. Ninth grade was the brightest year of my academic life until now. I started falling in love with books again after I walked into the school library and read more books about science and health. I found the books pretty realistic and helpful for me.
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
In Vietnam, students take a test when they are around fourteen years old to decide whether they will go to a normal school or a gifted high school. The high school principal organized the class by seeing my middle school report and based it on a group of classes I needed to focus to pass the college’s test. I was lucky to get into a really good class with people who were trying to get into a gifted high school. This was the time my life changed for the second time. I met my best friend, who like me, did not pass tests to get into the gifted school. She is so talented. She is always at the top of our class at the regular high school. She shared her astronomy hobby with me and helped me realize that I needed to work harder.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  At the beginning of junior year I had to move to America. When my grandpa on my mom's side was still alive, he wanted to bring my family to America for a better future. At the time I moved here, everything was brand new to me. I knew that Carmel High School was a good school. My family told me that I have to work harder in Carmel because people around here are so talented. When I go to school here, it opens my mind a lot about the world. In Vietnam, it’s hard to approach knowledge resources but here we welcome and offer students a lot of opportunities to approach knowledge. To graduate every student has to have a certain amount of community service hours. I think this is very useful because it is a chance for students to discover what they like and work on their passion. For me, it was a really helpful time to volunteer at the Yellow Bricks Road Bookstore. I had time to talk with people around me. They taught me a lot and I learned a lot. I love that place with a lot of books. I was deep into the world I want to live in by traveling through words. It was an amazing experience.

    <font color=" white"> How My Family Members Inspired Me to be a Lifelong Learner</font>
    </marquee>
</h1>     
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
 My dad always encouraged me to learn. He was an office worker for the local government district, but because the salary was so low, he quit that job to work at any jobs available at that time to make a living. He often worked in construction. I remember he left for work every day on his blue bicycle. He is a slim guy with a face with a lot of winkles. His clothes always looked dirty and old. Even though he did not get a higher education, I have learned so much from him. He did not care what grade I got in classes. He only cared about what I learned in classes. He was the first role model who brought a light to learning for me. When we were not living together, he always tried to help me out with my homework. At that time, I did not understand how important education is. He remembered all the knowledge from elementary school to high school that he learned. I was surprised how smart he was. He has always been the king of my life. 
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
Even though he was just a bricklayer, he was always passionate about learning. He always brought me books when he came to visit me. At that time, I did not care that much, but now when I am writing this, tears are rolling down my cheek. It is hard to find someone who works at manual labor and always wants to deepen his knowledge. Even though his eyesight is getting weak, he always reads newspapers and books about Chinese traditional medicine and grows plants. Being a lifelong learner is not the only thing I learned from him. He always said to me that “it is the best to be humble; don’t think highly of yourself.” I was a person with a really high ego. In our world, high mountains must have other higher mountains to motivate us to work harder. My dad is my higher mountain by building his knowledge everyday. He knows that if he stops he will be behind. He inspires me to continue to grow and keep learning to help me become a useful member of society.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
My mom gave up her dream of living in America to marry my dad. My grandpa and a lot of family members tried to persuade her to come to America, but she was thirty-seven and she was scared of never getting married. When my parents divorced, she had made up her mind to give me a better life. She not only sacrificed for her kids. She sacrificed all her future by giving up school since third grade to work and make a living for her seven siblings. Writing this memoir makes me feel guilty because for a long time I haven’t appreciated what she is doing for me. What she is doing is a silent sacrifice. She always helps me do chores and others house duties so that I have more time to study. I never thought about that until now. My mother’s sacrifices allow me to become a lifelong learner.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
She never told me anything about school or shared her dreams with me. But when I was doing this project, I asked her about her dreams in life for me. This is the first time she shared with me about her hopes for me to become successful and happy. I was crying when I wrote this paragraph about her. I realize that every mom always wants the best for their kids. She always reminds me that I need to study more. My mother was not always affectionate to me, but all her words about her dreams for me touched my heart. I would not have been successful on the journey to becoming a lifelong learner without the silent support from my mom.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
My uncle always shares with me what I need to improve, always gives advice. All things he shares with me like a dad shares with their offspring. He doesn’t have kids. He is the person who inspired me to read books. He brought a lot of books for me on topics such as science, literature, and lifestyle. He is currently working in the military of Vietnam as colonel. He knows three languages: Vietnamese, a little bit Chinese, and French. He always says, “Reading is an endless source of knowledge. Is the asset of mankind. Please take advantage of it.” When I heard it, my mind was opened. He doesn't talk much but everything he says has an insightful meaning. I am not only learning from him to love books, I learn from him how to be human. The way I need to deal with any situation. So the version of myself today is much better than a few years ago. I am not perfect so I need to learn more to improve myself.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
My cousin, Thoa, is 36 years old. She is my role model. She has a really good academic profile. When she was a younger girl, she attended many activities at school and won some awards in English and Chemistry. She is a role model in the same way that my dad and my uncle were role models for me in learning by action. Even after a flood, when other kids would play in the water, she always sat at her desk to learn. When I was in middle school, I came to her house looking for old school pictures for all her achievements. She attended so many competitions and awards. She was representative of the whole country to the capital as an excellent student in fifth grade. Talking about her achievements makes me feel so proud to be her cousin. She broke through gender discrimination that a girl can’t do what a boy can do as well as economic prejudice because some people criticized her that she was just a countryside girl who did not have any right to study Information Technology. At that time the internet was not popular like it is today. She has an Information Technology Bachelor’s Degree, a Computer Science Masters Degree, and several certificates in English and French that she earned from Universities in France. It’s hard to see her because the company she works for has branches around the world, so she seldom comes home. She usually comes home on Tet holiday, but she is always working and learning all the time. That’s the reason why she is always on top at her work place. She is always a role model for me to never stop learning even though she has some achievements in her life but she still never stops pushing herself forward. Because we are Asian, we don’t talk about our goals but I am sure that she set goals for herself really high. All that she is doing motivates me to do better than her.

    <p style="text-indent: 40px">

My literature teacher in eighth grade had a negative impact on my learning. I went to her class in school and outside of school for tutoring. She pointed out my mistakes and embarrassed me in front of everyone. She hurt my desire for education and learning. One day a young lady around thirty in a traditional costume was presenting her speech in the front of the classroom during literature class. She asked me questions but I did not give her a good answer like she wanted. Then her face changed and she said; “Which language are you speaking?” My face changed color and I started crying. Since that time, my image of her has been negative. Also I believe the reason why she was so mean to me was because I stopped coming to her tutoring class outside school in the second semester because I felt I was wasting my parent’s money. In Vietnam, if you pay for extra classes for sure you can get higher grades. After that I was trying to be good at Vietnamese literature without any help or extra classes.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
Vietnam’s educational system wants to create a person who is good at many things, so students are forced to take thirteen different classes at the same time as high school students. They are teaching more academic rather than creative. They still are impacted from the old education system that has been there over thousands of years. With traditional education creating so many talented people who are good at many things. It prepared me really well with basic knowledge to make my life easier. Vietnam creates so many talented people, but it doesn’t have a good environment to develop their skills so they go to study abroad. It is also called brain drain. The education system really lacks management and still has unfair things happen. Some people have really good relationships with people who have good positions. We call it nepotism. This inspires me to not need anyone to help me. The only thing I can do is work harder. I also believe when you are really talented then you will bloom.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
America has a better school system. America's educational system focuses more on developing human skills and interests. When countries have a better educational system, they will have a more developed economy and a potential to create many talented people. America is also well-known for their educational freedom, so students can choose classes. Everyone is equal. Everyone has the right to speak and to be heard. Each student can talk with their teacher like a friend about their learning and what the teacher needs to improve in the lesson and can give ideas for lessons. Schools in America are building important skills for their students in order to help them have a bright future using activities like group work, creative projects, and public speaking. America is really strict with plagiarism. If anyone does that they will get in big trouble in their life. Vietnam is not strict about plagiarism. They don't respect personal effort that much. The teaching style in Vietnam consists of reading for school and copying all of the teacher’s lectures in their notebooks. The American educational system is not perfect, but it is still better than Vietnam's educational system. 
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
Mr. McCarty, who is a great example of an American teacher, is pretty special in my eyes. He is really humble and knowledgeable. I want to surround myself with people who are unique like him. His class was the first class I took when I first went to Carmel High. The first time I came to his class, he wasn’t there. I sat in the first seat after walking into the classroom. I did not speak good English like I do now. I had to use Google translate. He is truly a good teacher. He always tried to make my assignments easier but still including what we learn in school. I took his class twice. I still remember that one day before an English assignment was due, I ran to his classroom to ask for help. He always believed that I could do whatever I wanted. He is also a good advisor and my good friend. He is a really quiet person, but introverts always have the power to attract people. Because he is so quiet, I need to talk to him to learn from him. His quietness forced me to use my language to learn from him. For me, I really want to surround myself in a good environment to help me learn and improve myself. I am deeply thankful that I know him.
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
I have another teacher in high school who treats us like college students. He throws assignments at us, but he is not clear on the way to complete the assignment. His teaching style is good for one type of student but not good for another type of student. The first type is the student who really loves to learn and is curious so she will try on her own to understand it. The second type of student is like me who is either too lazy or doesn't have the same ability like the first type of student to do it on her  own. If I don’t understand an assignment, I will not get the best result. When I go to talk to him to get help and try to understand but being a second language learner makes a difference, the style of his teaching makes learning harder but depending on the learning style of the student. What I learned from this is curious and the reason why I want to learn this class. That kept me on the right track. I can not go with the flow to get what I don’t want. I want myself to be the person who can control my life, not by the people around me or anyone else. The journey to becoming a lifelong learner is not always easy and rosy. At some point I want to give up because I tried my best to learn, but people still do not appreciate and respect my effort. There is prejudice in society too, but I deeply believe when I really want something I can make it happen. No one can stop me except myself. 
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
English is also not my mother tongue, so I have to work harder than a normal student. When you have too much free time, you don’t know how to fill it up, just sitting there and doing nothing. Time is precious, so I don’t want to waste it. I don’t want to regret any day or moment in my life. I am trying to enjoy every moment I have. During this pandemic, I need to learn more so when this will be over, I can be more confident to meet new people, have new friends, and be ready to enter life. I created my own schedule of what I have to do in a day to know what I am doing. There needs to be balance between study, sleep, and play. A way to motivate yourself is to set your own consequences if you don’t follow your schedule. For example, if I use social media before I do my homework or haven’t finished it, I have to exercise for thirty minutes or the next day I need to wake up thirty minutes earlier. Some days this works for me, but some days it does not.

    <p style="text-indent: 40px">

Today, we are living in an age where AI is developing so fast that games and social media make people waste their time a lot on it. The approach with books has changed into ebooks making readers easier to distract with notifications popping up on their phone or technology devices. It is hard for people to focus on reading, specifically young people who are not interested in reading. Knowledge is endless, but if we stop learning, we are absolutely backward. I remember someone said that knowledge is like a horizon line; when we move toward it, it will move farther. Books are how we move toward that horizon line. 
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
Everyone should cherish books as they are an enormous treasure trove. Why? A book takes a lot of time to write and a lot of thought to have a complete book. If you're twenty, and you read a book by an author aged forty, you have the experiences of forty years. It will help you to experience something like the author, and it is better to learn from their mistakes in life so you can avoid their mistakes. Books help you live so many lives by experiences through words. Some benefits of reading books are reduced stress, obtaining knowledge, being smarter, improving your vocabulary, boosting your memory, increasing focus, being more creative, and being entertained. You can read whenever and anywhere you want, and the best thing is you will have more friends who have the same hobby. When the internet grows like today, it is hard to recognize fake news but knowledge in books can help you spot it. 
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
The internet is really powerful. You can do so many things with it. If someone uses all that power they will be successful in the way they use it. I use the internet to search really fast. It takes under one second to have a lot of answers for your questions. Use it wisely by knowing what is good and bad for you. Back with books, not all books are good and not all them are bad. I want to share my tip to be careful and picky when choosing a book and the people you spend time with.  If the reader chooses the wrong book to read, it will impact them the way they think and act. Before reading any book, you should read reviews about the book, who recommended it, and what that book is talking about. Not everyone has good self-awareness to correct themselves about wrong things but it will take time to think and argue with the author. This is the time I gain my own wisdom about what I think about an idea that an author mentioned.

    <font color=" White"> The Power of Silence </font>
    </marquee>
</h1>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
 	According to Wolfgang von Goethe, a German poet, “Talent develops in quiet places, character in the full current of human life.” After we eat, we need to have time for digestion. Similarly, when we learn a lot we need to process knowledge into our brain to make it our own knowledge. This is why we develop in “quiet places.”  
 </br></br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">

	Silence has had power for such a long time. In my opinion, silence is not only quiet. It is not just the absence of noise. Silence is a mood when we are not distracted by noise. The only thing remaining is all our thoughts. If we divide the world into two worlds, inside and outside ourselves, then we can more easily understand ourselves better. When I am in a silent mood, I think a lot and find out the answers for myself. I am calm when I am in a silent mood. It is a time to reflect on what I did and what I need to do to improve to become a better person. Having a better version of myself today is a result of quiet self-reflection about what knowledge I have gained and how it has improved my character.
<p style="text-indent: 40px">
	In this hustle and bustle life, you are being engrossed in the flow of life with so many things to worry about that you forget to find your own space. Have you ever asked yourself if you are doing the right thing? Life has a lot of situations we need to solve in order to have good morals because you can more easily solve your problem if you spend some time in silent thought. Intellect is a category that refers to the knowledge and experience formed after the process of learning, but wisdom will not come if you do not spend time thinking about what you have learned. Another author, Haruki said, “Silence, I discover, is something you can actually hear.” This is so true for me because I can hear what I want when I am silent, and I understand myself better in silent moments.

Wisdom is a result of the whole process of learning, applying, relearning, and reapplying each new life lesson. Life changes us through the books we read and the people we meet. Don’t let school limit your ability to learn. A degree will never be enough. We all need to constantly learn, refresh, and update our professional skills. I am truly thankful I had the chance to write about my journey to becoming a lifelong learner.<p>
